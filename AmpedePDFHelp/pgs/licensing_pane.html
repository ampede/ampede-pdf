				<h1>The Licensing Pane</h1>
			</div>
			<p>The Licensing pane is where you can register/unregister your copy of PDF. It also provides a handy button to purchase PDF online, and access PDF's feature list.</p>
			<p><br><b>Purchase</b></p>
			<p>Clicking the <b>Purchase</b> button will open your default web browser and take you to PDF's purchase page. You can buy a license for PDF there.</p>
			<p><br><b>Info</b></p>
			<p>Clicking the <b>Info</b> button will open your default web browser and take you to PDF's product information page.</p>
			<p><br><b>Register</b></p>
			<p>After you have purchased a PDF license and received your serial number (via email), you're ready to register PDF. PDF can only be registered with a single license on one machine at a time.</p>
			<div id="taskbox">
				<ol>
					<li>To register your copy, click on the <b>Enter Serial Number</b> button and the LicenseControl application will open.
					<li>Enter your serial number in the <b>License ID:</b> text field. You may want to copy and paste from the email you received containing the number.
					<li>Click on the <b>Install a License</b> button. After agreeing to the Ampede PDF Software License Agreement (which you should read carefully), LicenseControl will contact the licensing server and register that copy of PDF with your license.
					<li>When the <b>License Status</b> changes from "Trial mode" to "Licensed for this system", quit LicenseControl.
					<li>Relaunch Final Cut Pro. You're all done!
				</ol>
			</div>
				<p><br><b>Unregister</b></p>
			<p>If you have already registered PDF and you want to unregister it (for example, to move it to a different machine, or even sell your license) you can!</p>
			<div id="taskbox">
				<ol>
					<li>Click on the <b>Unregister</b> button and the LicenseControl application will open. (This button is only visible if the plugin is already registered.)
					<li>In LicenseControl, click on the <b>Relinquish a License</b> button. This will unregister the copy of PDF you registered previously, and allow you to register a different copy (perhaps on a different machine).
				</ol>
			</div>
				<p><br><b>I upgraded PDF and now it says I'm unregistered. What's going on?</b></p>
				<p>When upgrading PDF to a new version, you will need to re-register the plugin. (We're working on improving this behavior.) But don't worry: you don't need to dig out your serial number.</p>
			<div id="taskbox">
				<ol>
					<li> Click the <b>Enter Serial Number</b> button. The LicenseControl application will open.
					<li> Now click the <b>Retrieve and Install an Existing License</b> button in LicenseControl. This will register your upgraded version automatically!
				</ol>
