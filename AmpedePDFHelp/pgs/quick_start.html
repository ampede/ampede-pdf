			<p>Using Ampede's PDF plugin is simple. The first step is to apply PDF to a clip. PDF is located in the <b>Effects</b> > <b>Video Filters</b> > <b>Ampede</b> menu. Once applied, PDF completely overwrites whatever image was on the clip to begin with, so it's best to apply it to a fast clip like Slug.</p>
			<p>After applying PDF, you'll see a default image in the viewer. Now is the time to select the Illustrator or PDF file you want PDF to rasterize.
			<div id="taskbox">
				<ol>
					<li>Click on PDF's <b>Options...</b> button visible in the Filters tab of the Viewer window. If you don't see Ampede PDF in the list of filters, try double-clicking the clip you applied PDF to.
					<li>The Ampede PDF window appears and the <b>File</b> pane is shown.
					<li>Click on the <b>Choose...</b> button and select the file you want PDF to rasterize in the open dialog that appears.
					<li> [Optional] Select a page in the file you chose by clicking on the <b>PDF</b> pane's icon and choosing a new page number.
					<li>Close the Ampede PDF window.
				</ol>
			</div>
			<p>After you have chosen a file, you'll want to force Final Cut Pro to update its internal render cache. This will free any cached frames it created from the default image.
			<div id="taskbox">
				<ul>
					<li>Click on PDF's <b>Force Update</b> checkbox visible in the Filters tab of the Viewer window.
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p>You can now use PDF's controls in the Filters tab of the Viewer window to scale, rotate, and move your file. The controls are fully keyframeable. For a complete description of each control, view the <a href="help:anchor=filter_controls bookID=Ampede%20PDF%20Help">Filter Controls</a> help.</p>
			<p>You can also add additional filters to the clip, such as a Guassian blur. Just be sure to add the filters <b>after</b> you apply PDF; otherwise, they won't be used.</p>
