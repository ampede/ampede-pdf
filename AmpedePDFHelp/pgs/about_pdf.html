			<p>Ampede PDF provides continuous rasterization of Adobe Illustrator and PDF files right inside Final Cut Pro HD. It is located in the <b>Effects</b> > <b>Video Filters</b> > <b>Ampede</b> menu.

			<p><b>Why is PDF a video filter?</b></p>
			<p>Conceptually, PDF is a <b>generator</b> like Bars and Tone or Slug. It should be placed in the Generator menu (at the bottom right of the Video tab), and it's controls should be in the Controls tab, not the Filters tab. This would also have the advantage of allowing PDF's output to be visible in the clip icon in the Final Cut Pro timeline. You also wouldn't have to go through the extra step of creating a dummy clip to apply PDF to.</p>
			<p>PDF isn't a generator because third-parties are not able to place plugins in the Generator menu without help from Apple. We are working with Apple to get PDF recognized as a generator; until then, PDF is a video filter that works like a generator.</p>
			<p>Filter or generator, the output is identical.</p>
